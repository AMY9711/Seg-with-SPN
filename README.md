## About the Code
* The code released here mainly consistes of two parts in the paper: foreground segmentation and instance recognition.

* It contains the parent net for foreground segmentation and training codes for instance recognition networks.

* The **matlab_code** folder contains a simple version of our CRAF step for segmentation refinement.


## Requirements
* Install `caffe` and `pycaffe` at http://caffe.berkeleyvision.org/.

* Download the [DAVIS 2017 dataset](http://davischallenge.org/code.html) and put it in the **data** folder.

* Download the pre-trained foreground/background model [here](http://vllab.ucmerced.edu/ytsai/CVPR17/PN_ResNetF.caffemodel) and put it in the **pretrained** folder.

## Training
* Train the per-object recognition model. <br />
`cd training` <br />
`python solve.py PATH_OF_MODEL PATH_OF_SOLVER` <br />
Foe example, on the 'choreography' video for the 1st object, run: <br />
`python solve.py ../pretrained/PN_ResNetF.caffemodel ../ResNetF/testnet_per_obj/choreography/solver_1.prototxt`

## Testing
* Test the general foreground/backgroung model. <br />
`python infer_test_fgbg.py PATH_OF_MODEL PATH_OF_RESULT VIDEO_NAME` <br />
Foe example, on the 'lions' video, run: <br />
`python infer_test_fgbg.py pretrained/PN_ResNetF.caffemodel results/fgbg lions`

* Test the object instance model. <br />
`python infer_test_perobj.py MODEL_ITERATION VIDEO_NAME OBJECT_ID` <br />
For example, on the 'lions' video for the 2nd object, run: <br />
`python infer_test_perobj.py 3000 lions 2`

* Run `example_CRAF.m` in the **matlab_code** folder for a demo on CRAF segmentation refinement.
